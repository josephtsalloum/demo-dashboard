## 9/9/24  Data Dashboard Attempt 

## My Goals for this will simple and stupid
## I want to create a reporting template for both TikTok and Amazon 
## I want to be able to break data down and see true profit and loss for the current data. 


#Before I had to sign off for the day I was able to get the filter logic added and I am currently working through debugging them and making them usable for the user. 

##I am basing this code off the video Budilding a Dashaord web app in Python = Full Streamlit Tutorial ( By Data Professor) & Coding is Fun 

## This method will use a streamlit method. I think this will be the most valueable and the best method for reporting espically for my needs and capabilities. 




## This is the data frame that will be used to call the data used within the dashboard 

##Use panadas to create the data frame

#######################  9 / 13/ 24 ######################### 

## This week I learned alot about software dev. This process is pretty fun and can be very rewarding. These are the type of projects I can do that will help me learn the coding assignments they teach in school. 

## The code I was able to finish this week is the following code below ### 

## The immporvements that this code has compared to the pervious code version is that the KPI filters work 100% correct this time. It also has a singluar dataframe and now has a duration filter to show the oldest and youngest campaigns. 
## Things that the dashboards needs are ? 
    # Visulizations --> What charts and views would I like to add to the dashboard 
    # What data breakdowns should this have ?? 
    # What are key data points that we should be able to see ?? --> Maybe a pie chart that shows the entire breakdown of the what each ASIN goes through on each sale. 

## What are things I want to add ? 

    # I want to be able to add a cache where I can stor e multiple months worth of data in one place. 
    # I want to be able to have the some visualizations that can be pre-built to match the data frame and will use the data to make certain layouts and veiws available. 

## My Goals for this will simple and stupid
## I want to create a reporting template for both TikTok and Amazon 
## This will ultimately be a quarterly reporting device but this can be used to track monthly data.
## I want to be able to break data down and see true profit and loss for the current data. 


##I am basing this code off the video Budilding a Dashaord web app in Python = Full Streamlit Tutorial ( By Data Professor) & Coding is Fun 

## This method will use a streamlit method. I think this will be the most valueable and the best method for reporting espically for my needs and capabilities. 




## This is the data frame that will be used to call the data used within the dashboard 

##Use panadas to create the data frame

 #This is the streamlit dataframe defition from the pandas data frame               


print(df.columns)





###--------------- Sidebar -------------------------### 
#This is where the data can be manipulated by the user 

#This is the top of the filter section 
st.sidebar.header("Filter the data here to find your desired outbreak")

#This is the sectoin where the different filters are available 


### Filter 1 ### 

# Status (Enabled or Paused) 
inactive_active = st.sidebar.multiselect(
    "Status",
    options=df["Status"].unique(),
    default=df["Status"].unique()
)


## Filter 2 ###

##This dictionary allows the KPI fitler columns to be mapped and selected down below in the filter button section 

kpi_mapping = {
    "Spend": "Spend",
    "(ACOS)" : "(ACOS)",
    "Sales (7 days)": "Sales (7 days)",
    "Impressions": "Impressions"
}

## These are the different filters and this is how the work together in order to update the data view and allow you to see the data you want. 
performance_kpi = st.sidebar.selectbox("Performance KPI Selector", list(kpi_mapping.keys()))
performance_order = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select Order", ["Ascending", "Descending"])
df_filtered = df[df["Status"].isin(inactive_active)]

if performance_kpi:
    if performance_order == "Ascending":
        df_filtered = df_filtered.sort_values(by=performance_kpi, ascending=True)
    else:
        df_filtered = df_filtered.sort_values(by=performance_kpi, ascending=False)

def filter_data(df, inactive_active, performance_kpi , performance_order):
    df_filtered = df[df["Status"].isin(inactive_active)]
    if performance_kpi:
      df_filtered = df_filtered.sort_values(by=kpi_mapping[performance_kpi], ascending = (performance_order =="Ascending"))
    return df_filtered

### Filter 4 ### DURATIONS / AGE 

age_options = ["Oldest to Youngest","Youngest to Oldest"]
age_filter = st.sidebar.selectbox("Age of Campaign Filter", age_options)

def filter_age(df, age_filter):
    if age_filter == "Oldest to Youngest":
        df_filtered - df.sort_values(by="Start Date", ascending = True)
    elif age_filter == "Youngest to Oldest": 
        df_filtered = df.sort_values(by="Start Date", ascending = False)
    return df_filtered









### This is the part of the code that updates the data frame and the includes the filter selections

## This is the part that save the selections on the filters and will update the df   
df_filtered = filter_data(df,inactive_active,performance_kpi, performance_order)
## updates data frame with the filtered selections 
st.dataframe(df_filtered)


 

## 9/11/24 --> The ACOS and Sales sections still do not work also the orginal data Does not appear to get changed. The filtered data gets printed in a new table which can be fine it could just get confusing in the future for others. 
## Spend and Impressions works perfectly. The ascending and descending order filters work as well with the data along with the status. maybe I should try a singluar selection method for the performance KPI
